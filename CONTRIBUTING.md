In order to commit / make a pull request, you need to modify the files composer.json and LICENSE and
add your own copyright notice in. This only needs to be done once - first commit or PR.

Add your name, email and homepage in the composer.json. The role should be Project Maintainer for the root maintainer,
Maintainer for a collaborator (write-access) and Contributor for a PR request.

Also, add your copyright notice in LICENSE. Make sure to APPEND not prepend to the other copyright notices.

Format

```
Copyright (c) [year of first commit to repo] [name same as in composer.json] <email@address>
```

If you omit this notice (not sure why you'd want to as it's credit) we reserve the right to add a notice in using
your git commit details or your GitHub account details at any time in the future.
